> Launcher for Microsoft Edge.

This is a fork of the [launcher for Internet Explorer](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-ie-launcher).

## Status
In development, with pre-1.0 versions now available on the npm registry. It should work well in most cases but it has not been thoroughly tested. It is a known issue that Edge stays open after the plugin runs (see [issue #7](https://github.com/nickmccurdy/karma-edge-launcher/issues/7)).

## Installation

The easiest way is to keep `karma-edge-launcher` as a devDependency, by running

```bash
npm install karma-edge-launcher --save-dev
```

## Configuration
```js
// karma.conf.js
module.exports = function(config) {
  config.set({
    browsers: ['Edge']
  });
};
```

You can pass list of browsers as a CLI argument too:
```bash
karma start --browsers Edge
```
